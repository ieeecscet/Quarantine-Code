# Question

Mr. Ankush gave an assignment to Parikh and Navdeep. Parikh and Navdeep can complete that assignment in 28 days. 
With the help of an intern, they can finish it in 21 days. 
If the complete assignment was to be done by an intern, how long will the intern take to complete the assignment?

# Options

1. 75 days
2. 80 days
3. 84 days
4. 70 days

# Solution

Ans : 2

Assuming x, y, z are units of work done by Parikh, Navdeep and Intern in one day and total work be 100 units of work,
the equation would become: 28 * (x + y) = 100. x+y becomes 100/28. Now, it is also given that 21 * ( x+ y+ z) = 100.
Solving for z, we get, z = 25/21 units of work. If the intern does 25/21 units of work in one day, then by unitary method,
it will do 100 units of work in 84 days.
